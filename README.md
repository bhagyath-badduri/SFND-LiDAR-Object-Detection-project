# SFND-LiDAR-Object-Detection-project
Implemented a LiDAR-based 3D obstacle detection pipeline using C++ and the Point Cloud Library (PCL). The system performs point cloud filtering, ground plane segmentation using RANSAC, KD-tree–based Euclidean clustering, and 3D bounding box generation to detect obstacles in a simulated urban driving environment.
